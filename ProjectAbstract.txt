Our goal is to develop an autonomous delivery drone that will navigate its surroundings and complete deliveries with minimal or no human intervention. The drone is designed to receive target locations in the form of GPS or Cartesian coordinates, and by using Lidar sensors and an obstacle avoidance algorithm, it is programmed to deliver a payload to the destination, and then return to its starting point while utilizing LED lights on the drone to indicate the status of the delivery process. This project shows how modern technology can be combined and might lead to new ideas for creating better autonomous drones in the future.
